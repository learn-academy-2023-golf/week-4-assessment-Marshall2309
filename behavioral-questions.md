Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Why did you choose a career in software development?

- Nugget: I chose a career in software development because of my passion for learning, keen eye for detail and  commitment to enhancing efficiency.
- Situation: In my academic and life experiences, I have found myself naturally drawn to things that improve efficiency. I started a family business that requires a platform and web presence. None of the software developers that I contacted were able to help me to bring my vision for the family business to pass, so I decided to learn how to code so that I can create the platform for myself. 
- Task: Recognizing everyoneâ€™s inability to bring my vision to pass, I decided to explore a career in software development. I researched available options in my community as well as options outside of the Arizona area. The task at hand was to gain admission to a reputable school and complete the course and secure employment within a reasonable amount of time, specifically before my son is born.
- Action: To pursue this career path, I took proactive steps to deepen my understanding of software development principles by studying JavaScript, CSS, and HTML before the course started. I studied the material, participated in Learn Academy JumpStart, and actively participated in class to practice the information. 
- Result: As a result of my efforts, I was able to become more knowledgeable about software development. When I struggled with a concept, I reached out to my peers as well as individuals outside of the course to help me become more proficient. My journey into software development will not only fulfill my desire to build a platform for my family business, but it will also help me to secure a career that will allow me to spend more time with my wife and son.

2. In previous roles, how have you helped teammates succeed?

- Nugget: Through strategic planning and dedicated teamwork, I helped a new church to develop a vibrant youth ministry and engage young people in the community.
- Situation: I moved to Arizona to help establish a new church. Weeks before the church was scheduled to launch, the team was without a primary youth teacher.  The church leadership asked me to fill in until a replacement could be found. 
- Task: My task was to spearhead the creation and development of a youth ministry from scratch. This involved reviewing the material that students would be taught, teaching the material in an engaging way and building relationships with the youth in the church.
- Action: I worked closely with the church leadership to lay the foundation for a purpose-driven and impactful ministry. Specifically, I initiated the rollout of various activities tailored to the interests and needs of over 40 youth. This involved reviewing  all of the course materials prior to each Sunday service, leading the Bible lessons for students, and training additional teachers to facilitate the course in my absence.
- Result: Through diligent efforts and a collaborative approach, I was able to successfully launch the youth ministry for a new church. The youth ministry became an integral part of the church community, fostering spiritual growth and creating a positive impact on the lives of the young individuals involved.
