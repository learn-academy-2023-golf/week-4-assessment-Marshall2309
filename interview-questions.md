# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: I know that a DOM is a Document Object Model. The virtual DOM is a virtual version of it. 

Researched answer: The Virtual DOM (Virtual Document Object Model) is a concept and technique used in the React JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's an integral part of React's performance optimization strategy. It allows React to provide efficient, high-performance rendering of user interfaces by reducing the direct interaction with the slow real DOM. This is one of the key factors that make React a popular choice for building web applications.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: The return is implied.

Researched answer: In Ruby, the concept of "implicit return" means that a method automatically returns the value of the last executed expression without requiring you to use the return keyword explicitly. This behavior makes Ruby code concise and easy to read.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: They both use 'if' statements, returns, and variables. JS uses strict syntax, longer code, and is built so the computer can understand. Ruby has minimal syntax, shorter code, and is built for the human programmer.

Researched answer: Both JavaScript and Ruby are high-level, dynamically-typed languages. Both languages are object-oriented and they are interpreted languages. The differences are that JavaScript is primarily used for web development and runs in web browsers, while Ruby is a general-purpose language used for web development (Ruby on Rails), scripting, automation, and other applications. JavaScript uses C-style syntax and Ruby has a more unique and concise syntax, which emphasizes readability. JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. It's particularly known for its frontend libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js. Ruby has a strong ecosystem for web development, with the Ruby on Rails framework being a prominent example.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: Software that allows you to manage different versions of code. 

Researched answer: A version manager is a software tool or utility that allows developers to install, manage, and switch between different versions of programming languages, frameworks, or tools on their development environment. It provides a way to maintain multiple versions of software side by side, which is particularly important when working on projects that require specific versions to function properly.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: An anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome.

2. RSpec: (Ruby specification) is a domaine specific language used for testing the behavior of objects in the Ruby programming language.

3. Test-driven development: Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach in which developers write tests before they write the code that needs to be tested.
